        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business MarketingðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first-year undergraduate student at UC Riverside, currently planning to major in Business Marketing. My passion for leadership, community service, and cultural awareness has shaped my academic and extracurricular journey, allowing me to make meaningful contributions in various organizations.
During high school, I served as the President of the Philippine United Student Organization, where I played a key role in organizing meetings and designing activities aimed at celebrating cultural heritage and fostering community engagement. Under my leadership, the organization hosted cultural events, educational workshops, and social gatherings that strengthened the connection between students and their Filipino heritage.
Additionally, I was the Secretary of KASEC, a club dedicated to promoting awareness of children with disabilities that hinder their everyday lives. In this role, I helped coordinate meetings, plan events, and lead fundraising initiatives that successfully raised over $7,000 for the organization. Through these efforts, we were able to provide crucial resources and support for children in need, reinforcing my commitment to advocacy and community service.<br><br>

        Beyond my school-based leadership roles, I founded and directed Project Provide 4 Philippines in the summer of 2023. This initiative was born from my desire to make a tangible impact on underserved communities in the Philippines. I personally created and distributed care packages containing hygiene products and basic necessities to those in need. Additionally, I launched a social media campaign to raise funds for medical and everyday supplies, ensuring that these communities received the essential aid they required.
My dedication to healthcare and service also led me to volunteer as an assistant at Central Care Physical Therapy from 2022 to 2023. In this position, I greeted patients, monitored their progress during physical therapy sessions, and assisted therapists with various tasks. I also helped maintain the clinic by managing laundry, preparing patient rooms, and ensuring a clean and welcoming environment for all visitors. This experience deepened my understanding of the healthcare field and reinforced my passion for helping others.
In addition to my leadership and service experiences, I was actively involved in several extracurricular activities that further enriched my personal growth. As a Cross-Trainer at St. Paul the Apostle from 2023 to 2024, I facilitated three-day retreats to mentor younger students through activities and group discussions as they prepared for confirmation. I also collaborated with fellow Cross-Trainers in weekly meetings to design engaging themes, activities, and skits for these retreats.<br><br>

        As a Catechetical Student Body Member at St. Paul the Apostle, I worked on strategizing solutions based on student feedback to enhance educational activities and religious development. I helped organize unity nights that combined lessons, games, and discussions for confirmation students, while also arranging monthly meetings on worship and religious themes for younger students.
Furthermore, my membership in the National Honor Society from 2022 to 2024 allowed me to contribute to school competitions, community service events, and various charitable initiatives. I assisted with directing parking, selling tickets, and working concessions, as well as donating supplies for craft kits, homeless shelters, and appreciation projects for teachers and veterans.
Lastly, as a member of Key Club from 2021 to 2024, I actively participated in community service by volunteering at food pantries, supervising elementary school events, managing booths at local festivals, and helping maintain public spaces. This experience reinforced my belief in the power of service and community engagement.
Through these experiences, I have developed strong leadership, organizational, and interpersonal skills that will continue to guide me throughout my academic and professional journey. I am eager to apply my passion for marketing, leadership, and service to future endeavors, making a positive impact on both local and global communities.
